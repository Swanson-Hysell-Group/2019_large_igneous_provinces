# Large_Igneous_Provinces

## Plan

### Figures

* LIP distribution through time (heat map)
    * using a few different models:
        * no attenuation
        * decay with half lives derived from present day areal extent - perhaps not necessary to have a separate model that accounts for burial
* LIPs in the tropics through time
* ice extent
* statistics/correlation figure
