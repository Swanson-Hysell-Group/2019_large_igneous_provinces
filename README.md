# Large_Igneous_Provinces

## Plan

### Figures

* LIP distribution through time (heat map)
    * using a few different models:
        * no attenuation
        * decay with half lives derived from present day areal extent
        * same as above, but accounting for burial
* LIPs in the tropics through time
    * with the same models as above
* fractional LIP area vs time since emplacement
    * all LIPs to
* ice extent
* statistics/correlation figure
* global map showing LIP polygons - both present day and inferred original
* table with columns:
    * name
    * eruption age
    * original area
    * present day area
    * model half life
    * buried or not buried

### Text

* LIP record
    * mention that it is likely overestimate of original area
    * discuss importance of post-emplacement history
    * describe method
* ice extent record
* correlation between the two
